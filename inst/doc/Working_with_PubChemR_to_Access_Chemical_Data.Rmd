## 1. Introduction

The `PubChemR` package is designed for R users who need to interact with the PubChem database, a free resource from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). PubChem is a key repository of chemical and biological data, including information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and physical properties, biological activities, patents, health, safety, toxicity data, and much more.

This package simplifies the process of accessing and manipulating this vast array of data directly from R, making it a valuable resource for chemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, and researchers in related fields. In this vignette, we will explore the various functionalities offered by the `PubChemR` package. Each function is designed to allow users to efficiently retrieve specific types of data from PubChem. We will cover how to install and load the package, provide detailed descriptions of each function, and demonstrate their usage with practical examples. 

## 2. Installation

The `PubChemR` package is can be installed either from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or directly from its GitHub repository, offering users the flexibility to choose between the stable CRAN version or the latest development version with potentially newer features and fixes.

### Installing from CRAN
For most users, installing `PubChemR` from CRAN is the recommended method as it ensures a stable and tested version of the package. You can install it using the standard R package installation command:

```{r install_package, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("PubChemR")
```

This command will download and install the `PubChemR` package along with any dependencies it requires. Once installed, you can load the package in your R session as follows:

```{r library, warning=FALSE}
library(PubChemR)
```

### Installing the Development Version from GitHub

For users who are interested in the latest features and updates that might not yet be available on CRAN, the development version of `PubChemR` can be installed from GitHub. This version is likely to include recent enhancements and bug fixes but may also be less stable than the CRAN release.

To install the development version, you will first need to install the `devtools` package, which provides functions to install packages directly from GitHub and other sources. You can install devtools from CRAN using:

```{r install_devtools, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once devtools is installed, you can install the development version of `PubChemR` using:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("selcukorkmaz/PubChemR")
```

This command downloads and installs the package from the specified GitHub repository. After installation, load the package as usual:

```{r load_PubChemR}
library(PubChemR)
```

## 3. Implementation

The `PubChemR` package offers a suite of functions designed to interact with the PubChem database, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate chemical data efficiently. Below is an overview of the main functions provided by the package:

### 3.1. Retrieving AIDs with get_aids()

The `get_aids` function is designed to retrieve Assay IDs (AIDs) from the PubChem database. This function is useful for accessing detailed assay data related to specific compounds or substances, which is crucial in fields such as pharmacology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

The function supports a range of identifiers including integers (e.g., CID and SID) and strings (e.g., name, SMILES, InChIKey and formula). Users can specify the namespace and domain for the query, as well as the type of search to be performed (e.g., substructure, superstructure, similarity, identity).

Here are the main parameters of the function:

* `identifier:` A vector of positive integers (e.g. cid, sid) or identifier strings (name, smiles, inchikey, formula).
* `namespace:` Specifies the type of identifier provided.
* `domain:` Specifies the domain of the query.
* `searchtype:` Specifies the type of search to be performed.
* `options:` Additional arguments.

```{r aids_by_cid}
aids_by_cid <- get_aids(
  identifier = c(2244, 2519, 3672),
  namespace = "cid",
  domain = "compound"
)

aids_by_cid
```
The above code retrieves AIDs for the compounds with CIDs 2244, 2519 and 3672. The output shows the request details including the domain (Compound), namespace (Compound ID), and identifier (2244, 2519, ... and 1 more). This provides a summary of the query performed.

To retrieve the  AIDs associated with these compounds, we use the `AIDs` function on the result. This getter function return the results either as a tibble (data frame) or as a list, depending on the `.to.data.frame` argument.

```{r aids_by_cid_getter}
aids <- AIDs(object = aids_by_cid, .to.data.frame = TRUE)
